## Coding style.

### Python

The python code should adhere to pep8

### Protobuf

There's a vim modeline that should get you close.

## Backwards compatibility

For now, break backwards compatibility with impunity. Preface breaking commit
messages with !! to make it easy to track down what will break things.
