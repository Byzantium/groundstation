{"name":"Groundstation","tagline":"","body":"groundstation\r\n=============\r\n\r\ngroundstation is a decentralised task/project management suite.\r\n\r\nThe core of its implementation is an object store of linked immutable objects\r\nthat are synced via a gossip protocol.\r\n\r\nThe current version uses libgit2 as a storage backend, but doesn't use many git\r\nprimitives, beyond git's objects as a storage medium. This may change in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\npygit2\r\n------\r\n\r\ngroundstation uses pygit2 under the hood for its git interactions, and some\r\nfeatures that it depends on have not landed in a stable release yet.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, you'll need to build and install the latest [libgit2][1] and\r\n[pygit2][2] from source.\r\n\r\nprotocol support\r\n----------------\r\n\r\ngroundstation hinges on the notion of protocols internally- groundstation core\r\nprovides you with content addressable storage, but it's up to you to work out\r\nwhat to actually do with that data.\r\n\r\nThat said, groundstation does ship with some protocol adaptors. Adaptors take\r\nthe form `name@domain:adaptor-version`, and until such time as a release is\r\nalready, everything that ships with groundstation will be released with\r\n`richo@psych0tik.net` as the email.\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\ngroundstation uses [babashka][3] for managing it's dependencies. If you have it installed, you should be able to do something like:\r\n\r\n`babashka groundstation_dev` and wind up with a working environment. Maybe.\r\n\r\n1. install development libgit2 (on OSX this is streamlined by `brew install --HEAD libgit2`)\r\n2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n3. ???????\r\n4. profit!\r\n\r\nYou'll almost certainly want to have a read of the [hacking document](HACKING.md),\r\nand checkout the other [misc hacking docs](HACKING/).\r\n\r\n[1]:http://libgit2.github.com/\r\n[2]:https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2#building-on-nix-including-os-x\r\n[3]:https://github.com/richo/babashka\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
